# pca_saxs_simul
Applying PCA on simulated SAXS curves
SAXS 1d data was created ny program bodies (packet ATSAS, EMBL)
Three models were used: sphere, cylinder, parallelipiped. 
In this project we wanted to see whether using principal component analysis it is possible to classify our data (whether loading scores allow to separate these three groups from each other)
